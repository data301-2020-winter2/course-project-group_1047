## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Though we understand that movies are perhaps one of the most common ways in which people find commonalities, it doesn't dilute our love for them. All the members of this group are cinephiles that love motion pictures, and understand their importance in life. However, what we found more interesting is how filmmaking itself has started embracing audience preferences, thus starting a new age of content where the artist is more influenced by the responsiveness of their art, rather than their artistic integrity. This can be seem quite influentially on how Netflix and Amazon Prime Video are funding various production teams to create content that appeals to specific target segments all across the world, while at the same time investing in bringing notable and famous executives to help plan their slate of movies. This can be seen by the current trend of streaming giants hiring notable figures, such as Netflix getting former US President Barack Obama a deal to create a range of content! What’s fascinating is Netflix has already been relying on a network of such individuals to help boost their streaming service, which is great, because at the end of the day, the consumer always gets more content!. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our data set contains general information about all the content featured on Netflix as of 2019. This contains information such as the title; type of content; the director; the cast; the country where the content was made; the date it was added to Netflix; the year it was released; the content’s rating (PG-13, TV- MA, etc.), and the duration. We believe we can use this data to get a number of insights:
- We can learn about the frequency of genres focused in different regions, and consequently track which cast and crew tend to work in what types of content. 
- Moreover, we can also use this data to help comment on the range of certain notable cast & crew, or for that matter the variation in the audiences they’ve presented to based on their respective titles’ ratings. 
- We can also try to validate the current trend we can see of increasing the amount of TV shows on streaming services when compared to movies, and the pace at which this seems to be happening.
